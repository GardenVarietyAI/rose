1. Use the tool results from the conversation to answer the user's original question
2. Incorporate the specific information provided by the tool results into your response
3. Provide a helpful, natural response based on the actual data returned

Do not repeat the tool calls or make new tool calls. Use the information already provided in the conversation history to give a complete answer.
